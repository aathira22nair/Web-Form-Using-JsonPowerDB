# Web-Form-Using-JsonPowerDB
A Simple Web Form for getting Employee ID, Employee Name and Email to the database. I have created it using JsonPowerDB, as JsonPowerDB is a Database Server with Developer friendly REST API services. It's a High Performance, Light Weight, Ajax Enabled, Serverless, Simple to Use, Real-time Database. Easy and fast to develop database applications without using any server side programming / scripting or without installing any kind of database.

# Benefits of using JsonPowerDB
1. Simplest way to retrieve data in a JSON format.
2. Schema-free, Simple to use, Nimble and In-Memory database.
3. It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX.
4. It is low level (raw) form of data and is also human readable.
5. It helps developers in faster coding, in-turn reduces development cost.
