# Web-Form-Using-JsonPowerDB
A Simple Web Form for getting Employee ID, Employee Name and Email to the database. I have created it using JsonPowerDB, as JsonPowerDB is a Database Server with Developer friendly REST API services. It's a High Performance, Light Weight, Ajax Enabled, Serverless, Simple to Use, Real-time Database. Easy and fast to develop database applications without using any server side programming / scripting or without installing any kind of database.
